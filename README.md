In these scripts, we train a simple nanoGPT model on the Tiny Shakespeare dataset on a MacBook Pro with an M4 Pro chip. We train the model for 5 epochs to a validation cross-entropy loss of around 1.85. Each epoch takes around 7 minutes, but I'm sure this can be optimized. 

Some example generated text is as follows:



Of course, this is not a great model, but we were at least able to build it locally.
